# Enumerable Methods Implementation

This project aims to replicate the functionality of the following `Enumerable` module methods:

- `#each` => `#my_each`
- `#each_with_index` => `#my_each_with_index`
- `#select` => `#my_select`
- `#all?` => `#my_all?`
- `#any?` => `#my_any?`
- `#none?` => `#my_none?`
- `#count` => `#my_count`
- `#map` => `#my_map`
- `#inject` => `#my_inject`
